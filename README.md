# z390 Assembly Unit Test

This is a toy project to explore automated unit testing and test-driven development for z390 assembly language code. It was developed using IBM's [Portable Mainframe Assembler and Emulator](http://www.z390.org/Linux/z390_Linux_Installation.htm#Installing%20z390%20on%20Linux) on Ubuntu Linux.

Source files whose names end with T are test programs. For example, REGEXT.MLC contains the unit tests for REGEX.MLC.

The project is not of immediate practical use. It's a vehicle for learning and exploration.
